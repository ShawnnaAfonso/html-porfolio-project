<hr />
<h3>Count of Monte Cristo</h3>
<p>An old movie but worth watching.I like the story and the character development.</p>
<h3>How to Train your Dragon Series</h3>
<p>The best animated movies in terms of the story and character development.Movies that have multiple parts, Usually lose meaning after the second part but all parts of this series have meaning and a good story to tell.</p>
<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>
<p>A good movie to watch with kids and family.</p>
